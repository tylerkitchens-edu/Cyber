      <h3>Understanding Cyber Threats</h3>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving as attackers develop new strategies to exploit vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and human behavior. Threats can originate both internally and externally and may target data confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Understanding these threats is critical to designing and implementing effective defenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vulnerabilities</strong> are weaknesses in software, hardware, or organizational processes that can be exploited. Regular assessments, patching, and configuration management reduce the likelihood of successful attacks.
      </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Common Threat Types</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Malicious software designed to damage, steal, or gain unauthorized access to systems. Includes viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware, rootkits, and trojans.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Exploiting human psychology to manipulate individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security.</li>
        <li><strong>Network-Based Threats:</strong> Attacks targeting network infrastructure, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Man-in-the-Middle (MitM), and port scanning.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Types of Malware</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Viruses:</strong> Infect and modify files, often corrupting data or creating backdoors.</li>
        <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Encrypts files and demands payment for decryption keys.</li>
        <li><strong>Spyware:</strong> Monitors user activity and collects sensitive information covertly.</li>
        <li><strong>Worms:</strong> Self-replicating malware that spreads across networks without user interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Rootkits:</strong> Hide deep in systems, often modifying OS components to conceal malicious activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Trojans:</strong> Malicious software disguised as legitimate programs that create backdoors for attackers.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Social Engineering</h3>
      <p>
        Social engineering attacks exploit human behavior rather than technical vulnerabilities. Common attack methods include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Mass emails impersonating trusted organizations to steal credentials or deliver malware.</li>
        <li><strong>Spear Phishing:</strong> Targeted phishing using personal information to appear credible.</li>
        <li><strong>Tailgating:</strong> Gaining unauthorized physical access by exploiting human courtesy.</li>
        <li><strong>Vishing:</strong> Voice phishing using urgent phone calls to manipulate victims into revealing sensitive data.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Network-Based Threats</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):</strong> Overwhelms systems with traffic from multiple sources, disrupting legitimate access.</li>
        <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):</strong> Intercepts and potentially alters communications between two parties, often on unsecured networks.</li>
      </ul>
