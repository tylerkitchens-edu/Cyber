      <h3>Risk Management Practices</h3>
      <p>
        Effective risk management begins with identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential threats that could affect organizational assets. Risks can be classified as <strong>internal</strong> (originating from within the organization, e.g., employee errors or system misconfigurations) or <strong>external</strong> (originating outside the organization, e.g., cyberattacks, natural disasters). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Once risks are identified, organizations can apply appropriate mitigation strategies, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Risk Avoidance:</strong> Eliminating actions or exposures that introduce risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Transference:</strong> Shifting the risk to a third party, such as through insurance or outsourcing.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Acceptance:</strong> Acknowledging the risk and choosing to accept it without additional action.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Reduction:</strong> Implementing controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Risk Analysis Methods</h3>
      <p>Risk analysis allows organizations to quantify and qualify risks for informed decision-making. There are two main methods:</p>
      
      <h4>Quantitative Analysis</h4>
      <p>
        Quantitative analysis assigns real monetary values to potential damages and countermeasures. Key components include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Single Loss Expectancy (SLE):</strong> The expected monetary loss from a single occurrence of a threat. Example: a successful malware attack might cost $1,000 per incident.</li>
        <li><strong>Exposure Factor (EF):</strong> The percentage of the asset value lost due to the threat. For example, a 50% loss to a $1,000 asset would be $500.</li>
        <li><strong>Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO):</strong> How often a threat is expected to occur annually. Example: ARO = 2 means twice per year, ARO = 0.25 means once every four years.</li>
        <li><strong>Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE):</strong> The expected annual loss calculated as SLE x ARO. Example: If SLE = $1,000 and ARO = 0.25, then ALE = $250.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Qualitative Analysis</h4>
      <p>
        Qualitative analysis uses scenarios and subjective judgment rather than precise numeric values. This method focuses on risk ranking and prioritization. Techniques include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scenario Analysis:</strong> Considering “what-if” scenarios to evaluate potential impact.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Matrices:</strong> Mapping risks based on likelihood and severity (e.g., high, medium, low).</li>
        <li><strong>Expert Judgment:</strong> Leveraging the experience and insight of IT security professionals to assess risk probability and impact.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Qualitative analysis is useful when precise data is unavailable or when assessing emerging threats that lack historical evidence.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>NIST and the Risk Management Framework (RMF)</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</strong> provides a comprehensive set of standards, guidelines, and best practices for managing cybersecurity risk in organizations. NIST publications help organizations secure IT systems, protect sensitive information, and comply with regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)</strong> provides a structured process for managing security and privacy risk. The RMF includes seven key steps:
      </p>
      <img src="rmf.png">
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare:</strong> Essential activities to prepare the organization to manage security and privacy risks.
            <ul><strong>Purpose:</strong> Carry out essential activities to help prepare all levels of the organization to manage its security and privacy risks using the RMF <br/> <strong>Outcomes:</strong>
