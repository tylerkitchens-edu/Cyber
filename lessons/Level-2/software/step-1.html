      <h3>Intro to Software</h3>
      <p>Software refers to the programs, data, and instructions that enable a computer system to perform tasks. It is the set of instructions that control the behavior of the computer and its hardware components. There are three main types of software:</p>

      <h4>System Software</h4>
      <p>System software is a type of software that is responsible for managing the hardware components of a computer system and providing a platform for running other software applications. System software includes operating systems, device drivers, firmware, and utility programs. Operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, provide a foundation for other software applications to run on.</p>

      <h4>Application Software</h4>
      <p>Application software is designed to perform specific tasks or functions for users. Examples of application software include web browsers, word processors, graphics editors, and email clients.</p>

      <h4>Programming Software</h4>
      <p>Programming software includes all of the tools and programs that developers use to create and maintain software applications. Examples of programming software include integrated development environments (IDEs), compilers, and debuggers.</p>

      <p>In addition to these main types of software, there are also other categories of software, such as middleware, which is software that connects different applications and systems together, and enterprise software, which is used by businesses to manage their operations and data.</p>

      <h3>Operating Systems</h3>
      <p>Operating system vary by device as follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Workstations:</strong> Workstations (desktops, laptops, servers, etc.) generally use either Windows, MacOS, or Linux.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile Devices:</strong> The two most common operating systems for mobile devices are Android and iOS.</li>
        <li><strong>Embedded Systems:</strong> Many devices, such as gaming consoles, televisions, and smart cars, have embedded operating systems called firmware. These devices need a simple, reliable OS that runs in a relatively static environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Hypervisors:</strong> A special type of software called a hypervisor can be used to run multiple operating systems on the same hardware in a process called virtualization.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>OS Functions & Descriptions</h3>

      <h4>Graphical User Interfaces</h4>
      <p>One of the main functions of an operating system is to provide an interface between the computer and the user. Most modern operating systems use a graphical user interface (GUI), where pictures, icons, and other images are used to represent files, folders, and system controls. The GUI makes it easy for humans to understand and use.</p>

      <h4>Command Line Interfaces</h4>
      <p>Another way users interact with the operating system is using the command line interface. The command line accepts input from the keyboard, instead of a mouse or touchscreen.</p>

      <h4>Interface Between Applications and Hardware</h4>
      <p>Operating systems provide an interface between the computer's hardware and application software. Hardware communicates in raw physical signals, like pulses of electricity or light. Software interprets ones and zeroes as digital information. The OS takes data from the hardware and passes it to the software in a way the software can understand. The operating system takes instructions from the software and passes it to the hardware to be executed.</p>

      <h4>Disk Management</h4>
      <p>It's important for storage hardware to be well organized. If information is scattered around a disk in a haphazard way, it takes a long time for the computer to get the information it needs and the system slows down. Operating systems have disk management software that helps keep storage devices well organized and maintained.</p>

      <h4>File Management</h4>
      <p>The file management interface for Microsoft Windows is called File Explorer. Within this interface, you can create, delete, open, or rename files and folders. The files can be stored on a local disk or on other devices connected through a network server.</p>

      <h4>Process/Memory Management</h4>
      <p>Computers work by executing lists of instructions. Sometimes, computers need to run multiple lists of instructions, or processes, at the same time. The OS makes sure that each process is sent to the CPU in an orderly way.</p>

      <h3>OS Functions Continued</h3>

      <h4>Application Management</h4>
      <p>Operating systems manage applications installed on a system. The OS has tools to view, configure, and delete applications.</p>

      <h4>Service Management</h4>
      <p>The OS also runs services, which are processes that run automatically in the background. Services do things like indexing files for better searches, verifying that software is up to date, and backing up files.</p>

      <h4>Device Management</h4>
      <p>Another of the operating system's jobs is to know the hardware that is connected to the system, interpret instructions from the hardware, and send instructions to it by using a driver. Drivers are like interpreters that help the hardware and the OS to speak the same language.</p>

      <h4>Access Control/Protection</h4>
      <p>An important operating system role is security. Operating systems require users to log in with credentials before accessing sensitive information on the computer. One of these most important principles in network security is the principle of least privilege.</p>
