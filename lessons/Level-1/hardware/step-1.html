      <p>The development of the integrated circuit (IC) in the 1950s and 1960s was a major milestone in computer history, as it allowed for the creation of smaller and more efficient computers. This technology paved the way for the development of the first personal computers in the 1970s, which were groundbreaking in their ability to bring computing power to individuals rather than just large organizations.</p>

      <p>Today, computers are used in a wide variety of fields, from scientific research to entertainment and gaming. They have become an essential tool for businesses, governments, and individuals alike, enabling us to connect with others, process vast amounts of data, and explore new frontiers of knowledge.</p>

      <p>Looking to the future, it's clear that computer technology will continue to play an increasingly important role in our lives. As new breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and other cutting-edge fields are made, we can expect computers to become even more powerful, versatile, and transformative.</p>

      <p>Peruse Technology’s history! We’ve had a long road up to this point.</p>

      <h3 id="tool-heading">Tech is (just) a tool</h3>
      <p>Technology is neither inherently helpful nor harmful. It’s simply a tool. It can be used to inspire and catalyze change just as easily as it can be used in ways that are detrimental to society.</p>

      <h3 id="computer-heading">What is a Computer?</h3>
      <p>The word "Computer" was first used in the 16th century for a person who computed. Now, a computer is an electronic machine that collects information, stores it, processes it according to user instructions, and returns the result.</p>
